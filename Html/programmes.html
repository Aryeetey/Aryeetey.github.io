<h1>PROGRAMMES</h1>
<h5>Stage One: Application and Interview</h5>
<p>To apply to the programme you’ll need to make the first stage payment for £69, this shows commitment to the programme and covers the cost of the interview.. Once this payment is made, you’ll receive an application. After you have complete your application and returned it back to the team, we’ll review your application and, if you are a rock star on paper, invite you to do an interview with either a member of staff or your local campus manager. These interviews are informal, but informative meetings that allow us to get to know you and your skills better so that we can ensure you have the strongest application possible and that we have the correct information about you to match you up with the right camp.</p><br>
<h5>Stage Two: Documentation</h5>
<p>Once the interview is done you will have 14 days to submit the rest of your application, 3 references and a short application video. This is how the Camp Directors in Canada will get to know what kind of person you are on a personal level so make sure you talk about your skills in your video and include a few photos of you doing them. The references cannot be from friends or family members and must contain active contact details so we can verify them. Teachers, employers or coaches are the best references to fill out the forms.</p>
<h5>Stage Three: Placement and Visa</h5>
<p>This part of the process is when we work hard to match you with the best camp for you and then get you prepared to make your way to Canada. You will either be placed through our system or at one of our Camp Fairs. These fairs are great opportunities to have more control over the camp you will be placed at and have the possibility to be placed with a friend. At these fairs you will meet face to face with the Camp Directors and show off your amazing personality and brag about your skills.</P><br>
<h5>Learning/Mental Disability and/or Developmental Delay Camps</h5>
<p>These camps are attended by children with learning/mental disability and/or developmental delays and camp activities are adapted to ensure the enjoyment of their experience and help them develop their talents . These camps may include adults.</p><br>
